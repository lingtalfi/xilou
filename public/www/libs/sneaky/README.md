Best of my jquery helpers packed in a library.




Blabla
-----------
Whether or not to use jquery is a big decision in a developer's life.
For some of my projects, I use jquery because of the development speed it gives me.
In that case, I still need some not built-in jquery functions from time to time.

So this library is the collection of functions I use on my projects.
It's purely based on pragmatic experience (i.e. it only contains functions that I actually used at least once).

I tried to name the functions with the first word acting like a namespace, and being the most important/representative
of the function role/target.

Also, as a naming convention, I like to prefix jquery objects with lowercase "j", and dom objects with lowercase "d".
